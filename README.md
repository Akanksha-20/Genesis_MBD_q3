 Using the bilinear transformation, design a highpass filter,
monotonic in passband with cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz and down 10 dB at 350 Hz.
The sampling frequency is 5000 Hz. Implement using basic building blocks. Show the
derivation for this filter. Demonstrate the filterâ€™s output for 5 different frequencies
ranging from 100 Hz to 10000 Hz. Choose these frequencies smartly to demonstrate
the filter working.
